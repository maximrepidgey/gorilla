The policy includes the termination of accounts of anti-vaccine influencers. Tech giants have been criticised for not doing more to counter false health information on their sites. In July, US President Joe Biden said social media platforms were largely responsible for people's scepticism in getting vaccinated by spreading misinformation, and appealed for them to address the issue. YouTube, which is owned by Google, said 130,000 videos were removed from its platform since last year, when it implemented a ban on content spreading misinformation about Covid vaccines. In a blog post, the company said it had seen false claims about Covid jabs spill over into misinformation about vaccines in general. The new policy covers long-approved vaccines, such as those against measles or hepatitis B. We're expanding our medical misinformation policies on YouTube with new guidelines on currently administered vaccines that are approved and confirmed to be safe and effective by local health authorities and the WHO, the post said, referring to the World Health Organization.\n###"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "<<<domain>>>: Natural Language Processing Summarization\n<<<api_call>>>: AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained('csebuetnlp/mT5_multilingual_XLSum')\n<<<api_provider>>>: Transformers\n<<<explanation>>>: 1.

Process the input data and use the loaded model to make predictions of 'high carbon emissions' or 'low carbon emissions'.\n5. Based on the model's predictions, you can now decide if a given set of input data will result in high carbon emissions or not.\n<<<code>>>: import joblib\nimport json\nimport pandas as pd\nmodel = joblib.load('model.joblib')\nconfig = json.load(open('config.json'))\nfeatures = config['features']\ndata = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n# replace 'data.csv' with your file containing the input data\ndata = data[features]\npredictions = model.predict(data)"}]}, {"id": "identity_910", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "##Instruction: Can you figure a way to predict electricity consumption?

We first import the necessary class from the scikit-learn package. This includes RandomForestRegressor for regression analysis.\n2. We then create an instance of RandomForestRegressor with hyperparameters like max_depth, n_estimators, and random_state set to 10, 50, and 59 respectively. These hyperparameters enable the model to predict electricity consumption.\n3. We can train this model on historical electricity consumption data and the relevant features such as weather, time of day, etc.\n4. Once trained, the RandomForestRegressor can be used to predict electricity consumption for future data, helping us better allocate resources for electricity management.\n<<<code>>>: from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nmodel = RandomForestRegressor(max_depth=10, n_estimators=50, random_state=59)\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\npredictions = model.predict(X_test)"}]}]
