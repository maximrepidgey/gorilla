One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder.

Pant revealed the incident made India skipper Virat Kohli upset. I think, somebody threw a ball inside, at Siraj, so he [Kohli] was upset, said Pant in a virtual press conference after the close of the first day\\'s play.You can say whatever you want to chant, but don\\'t throw things at the fielders and all those things. It is not good for cricket, I guess, he added.In the third session of the opening day of the third Test, a section of spectators seemed to have asked Siraj the score of the match to tease the pacer. The India pacer however came with a brilliant reply as he gestured 1-0 (India leading the Test series) towards the crowd.Earlier this month, during the second Test match, there was some bad crowd behaviour on a show as some unruly fans threw champagne corks at India batsman KL Rahul.Kohli also intervened and he was seen gesturing towards the opening batsman to know more about the incident. An over later, the TV visuals showed that many champagne corks were thrown inside the playing field, and the Indian players were visibly left frustrated.Coming back to the game, after bundling out India for 78, openers Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed ensured that England took the honours on the opening day of the ongoing third Test.At stumps, England\\'s score reads 120/0 and the hosts have extended their lead to 42 runs. For the Three Lions, Burns (52) and Hameed (60) are currently unbeaten at the crease.Talking about the pitch on opening day, Pant said, They took the heavy roller, the wicket was much more settled down, and they batted nicely also, he said. But when we batted, the wicket was slightly soft, and they bowled in good areas, but we could have applied [ourselves] much better.Both England batsmen managed to see off the final session and the hosts concluded the opening day with all ten wickets intact, extending the lead to 42.(ANI)\\\\n\\\\nget_response(context)\", \\'performance\\': {\\'dataset\\': \\'cnn_dailymail\\', \\'accuracy\\': {\\'ROUGE-1\\': 36.604, \\'ROUGE-2\\': 14.64, \\'ROUGE-L\\': 23.884, \\'ROUGE-LSUM\\': 32.902, \\'loss\\': 2.576, \\'gen_len\\': 76.398}}, \\'description\\': \\'PEGASUS fine-tuned for summarization\\'}', metadata={})]###ASSISTANT: ", "response": "1.

An over later, the TV visuals showed that many champagne corks were thrown inside the playing field, and the Indian players were visibly left frustrated.Coming back to the game, after bundling out India for 78, openers Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed ensured that England took the honours on the opening day of the ongoing third Test.At stumps, England\\'s score reads 120/0 and the hosts have extended their lead to 42 runs.

Videos are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire video.\\'}', metadata={})]###ASSISTANT: ", "response": "1.

The architecture of the model is very similar to that of a standard Vision Transformer (ViT), with a decoder on top for predicting pixel values for masked patches. Videos are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire video.\\'}', metadata={})]###ASSISTANT: ", "response": "66.8% top-1 90.3% top-5"}

The architecture of the model is very similar to that of a standard Vision Transformer (ViT), with a decoder on top for predicting pixel values for masked patches. Videos are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire video.\\'}', metadata={})]###ASSISTANT: ", "response": "1.

An over later, the TV visuals showed that many champagne corks were thrown inside the playing field, and the Indian players were visibly left frustrated.Coming back to the game, after bundling out India for 78, openers Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed ensured that England took the honours on the opening day of the ongoing third Test.At stumps, England\\'s score reads 120/0 and the hosts have extended their lead to 42 runs.

But when we batted, the wicket was slightly soft, and they bowled in good areas, but we could have applied [ourselves] much better.Both England batsmen managed to see off the final session and the hosts concluded the opening day with all ten wickets intact, extending the lead to 42.(ANI)\\\\n\\\\nget_response(context)\", \\'performance\\': {\\'dataset\\': \\'cnn_dailymail\\', \\'accuracy\\': {\\'ROUGE-1\\': 36.604, \\'ROUGE-2\\': 14.64, \\'ROUGE-L\\': 23.884, \\'ROUGE-LSUM\\': 32.902, \\'loss\\': 2.576, \\'gen_len\\': 76.398}}, \\'description\\': \\'PEGASUS fine-tuned for summarization\\'}', metadata={})]###ASSISTANT: ", "response": "1.

The architecture of the model is very similar to that of a standard Vision Transformer (ViT), with a decoder on top for predicting pixel values for masked patches. Videos are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire video.\\'}', metadata={})]###ASSISTANT: ", "response": "The Eiffel Tower is a wrought iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France.

An over later, the TV visuals showed that many champagne corks were thrown inside the playing field, and the Indian players were visibly left frustrated.Coming back to the game, after bundling out India for 78, openers Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed ensured that England took the honours on the opening day of the ongoing third Test.At stumps, England\\'s score reads 120/0 and the hosts have extended their lead to 42 runs.

But when we batted, the wicket was slightly soft, and they bowled in good areas, but we could have applied [ourselves] much better.Both England batsmen managed to see off the final session and the hosts concluded the opening day with all ten wickets intact, extending the lead to 42.(ANI)\\\\n\\\\nget_response(context)\", \\'performance\\': {\\'dataset\\': \\'cnn_dailymail\\', \\'accuracy\\': {\\'ROUGE-1\\': 36.604, \\'ROUGE-2\\': 14.64, \\'ROUGE-L\\': 23.884, \\'ROUGE-LSUM\\': 32.902, \\'loss\\': 2.576, \\'gen_len\\': 76.398}}, \\'description\\': \\'PEGASUS fine-tuned for summarization\\'}', metadata={})]###ASSISTANT: ", "response": "1.

In July, US President Joe Biden said social media platforms were largely responsible for people\\'s scepticism in getting vaccinated by spreading misinformation, and appealed for them to address the issue. YouTube, which is owned by Google, said 130,000 videos were removed from its platform since last year, when it implemented a ban on content spreading misinformation about Covid vaccines. In a blog post, the company said it had seen false claims about Covid jabs spill over into misinformation about vaccines in general. The new policy covers long-approved vaccines, such as those against measles or hepatitis B. We\\'re expanding our medical misinformation policies on YouTube with new guidelines on currently administered vaccines that are approved and confirmed to be safe and effective by local health authorities and the WHO, the post said, referring to the World Health Organization.\\\\nmodel_name = csebuetnlp/mT5_multilingual_XLSum\\\\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\\\\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_name)\\\\ninput_ids = tokenizer(\\\\n [WHITESPACE_HANDLER(article_text)],\\\\n return_tensors=pt,\\\\n padding=max_length,\\\\n truncation=True,\\\\n max_length=512\\\\n)[input_ids]\\\\noutput_ids = model.generate(\\\\n input_ids=input_ids,\\\\n max_length=84,\\\\n no_repeat_ngram_size=2,\\\\n num_beams=4\\\\n)[0]\\\\nsummary = tokenizer.decode(\\\\n output_ids,\\\\n skip_special_tokens=True,\\\\n clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False\\\\n)\\\\nprint(summary)\", \\'performance\\': {\\'dataset\\': \\'xsum\\', \\'accuracy\\': {\\'ROUGE-1\\': 36.5, \\'ROUGE-2\\': 13.934, \\'ROUGE-L\\': 28.988, \\'ROUGE-LSUM\\': 28.996, \\'loss\\': 2.067, \\'gen_len\\': 26.973}}, \\'description\\': \\'This repository contains the mT5 checkpoint finetuned on the 45 languages of XL-Sum dataset.

While prior work has shown that scaling neural models in the number of parameters and the size of the data they are trained on gives improved results, we show that other ingredients are important for a high-performing chatbot. Good conversation requires a number of skills that an expert conversationalist blends in a seamless way: providing engaging talking points and listening to their partners, both asking and answering questions, and displaying knowledge, empathy and personality appropriately, depending on the situation. We show that large scale models can learn these skills when given appropriate training data and choice of generation strategy. We build variants of these recipes with 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter neural models, and make our models and code publicly available. Human evaluations show our best models are superior to existing approaches in multi-turn dialogue in terms of engagingness and humanness measurements.

The India pacer however came with a brilliant reply as he gestured 1-0 (India leading the Test series) towards the crowd.Earlier this month, during the second Test match, there was some bad crowd behaviour on a show as some unruly fans threw champagne corks at India batsman KL Rahul.Kohli also intervened and he was seen gesturing towards the opening batsman to know more about the incident. An over later, the TV visuals showed that many champagne corks were thrown inside the playing field, and the Indian players were visibly left frustrated.Coming back to the game, after bundling out India for 78, openers Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed ensured that England took the honours on the opening day of the ongoing third Test.At stumps, England\\'s score reads 120/0 and the hosts have extended their lead to 42 runs. For the Three Lions, Burns (52) and Hameed (60) are currently unbeaten at the crease.Talking about the pitch on opening day, Pant said, They took the heavy roller, the wicket was much more settled down, and they batted nicely also, he said. But when we batted, the wicket was slightly soft, and they bowled in good areas, but we could have applied [ourselves] much better.Both England batsmen managed to see off the final session and the hosts concluded the opening day with all ten wickets intact, extending the lead to 42.(ANI)\\\\n\\\\nget_response(context)\", \\'performance\\': {\\'dataset\\': \\'cnn_dailymail\\', \\'accuracy\\': {\\'ROUGE-1\\': 36.604, \\'ROUGE-2\\': 14.64, \\'ROUGE-L\\': 23.884, \\'ROUGE-LSUM\\': 32.902, \\'loss\\': 2.576, \\'gen_len\\': 76.398}}, \\'description\\': \\'PEGASUS fine-tuned for summarization\\'}', metadata={})]###ASSISTANT: ", "response": "Rishabh Pant revealed that someone from the crowd threw a ball at Mohammed Siraj during the third Test match against England, which left team captain Virat Kohli upset.

The architecture of the model is very similar to that of a standard Vision Transformer (ViT), with a decoder on top for predicting pixel values for masked patches. Videos are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire video.\\'}', metadata={})]###ASSISTANT: ", "response": "1.

An over later, the TV visuals showed that many champagne corks were thrown inside the playing field, and the Indian players were visibly left frustrated.Coming back to the game, after bundling out India for 78, openers Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed ensured that England took the honours on the opening day of the ongoing third Test.At stumps, England\\'s score reads 120/0 and the hosts have extended their lead to 42 runs.

Good conversation requires a number of skills that an expert conversationalist blends in a seamless way: providing engaging talking points and listening to their partners, both asking and answering questions, and displaying knowledge, empathy and personality appropriately, depending on the situation. We show that large scale models can learn these skills when given appropriate training data and choice of generation strategy. We build variants of these recipes with 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter neural models, and make our models and code publicly available.

An over later, the TV visuals showed that many champagne corks were thrown inside the playing field, and the Indian players were visibly left frustrated.Coming back to the game, after bundling out India for 78, openers Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed ensured that England took the honours on the opening day of the ongoing third Test.At stumps, England\\'s score reads 120/0 and the hosts have extended their lead to 42 runs. For the Three Lions, Burns (52) and Hameed (60) are currently unbeaten at the crease.Talking about the pitch on opening day, Pant said, They took the heavy roller, the wicket was much more settled down, and they batted nicely also, he said. But when we batted, the wicket was slightly soft, and they bowled in good areas, but we could have applied [ourselves] much better.Both England batsmen managed to see off the final session and the hosts concluded the opening day with all ten wickets intact, extending the lead to 42.(ANI)\\\\n\\\\nget_response(context)\", \\'performance\\': {\\'dataset\\': \\'cnn_dailymail\\', \\'accuracy\\': {\\'ROUGE-1\\': 36.604, \\'ROUGE-2\\': 14.64, \\'ROUGE-L\\': 23.884, \\'ROUGE-LSUM\\': 32.902, \\'loss\\': 2.576, \\'gen_len\\': 76.398}}, \\'description\\': \\'PEGASUS fine-tuned for summarization\\'}', metadata={})]###ASSISTANT: ", "response": "1.

An over later, the TV visuals showed that many champagne corks were thrown inside the playing field, and the Indian players were visibly left frustrated.Coming back to the game, after bundling out India for 78, openers Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed ensured that England took the honours on the opening day of the ongoing third Test.At stumps, England\\'s score reads 120/0 and the hosts have extended their lead to 42 runs.

The architecture of the model is very similar to that of a standard Vision Transformer (ViT), with a decoder on top for predicting pixel values for masked patches. Videos are presented to the model as a sequence of fixed-size patches (resolution 16x16), which are linearly embedded. One also adds a [CLS] token to the beginning of a sequence to use it for classification tasks. One also adds fixed sinus/cosinus position embeddings before feeding the sequence to the layers of the Transformer encoder. By pre-training the model, it learns an inner representation of videos that can then be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled videos for instance, you can train a standard classifier by placing a linear layer on top of the pre-trained encoder. One typically places a linear layer on top of the [CLS] token, as the last hidden state of this token can be seen as a representation of an entire video.\\'}', metadata={})]###ASSISTANT: ", "response": "I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow morning."}
